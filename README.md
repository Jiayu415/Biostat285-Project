# UCLA-Biostat285-Project: AI-Driven Insights on Chronic Disease Prediction and Medical Bill Estimation

# Introduction
This project combines a health dashboard with a machine learning-powered chatbot to provide personalized health insights and cost estimations for chronic disease management. The dashboard tracks key health metrics (such as blood pressure, glucose levels, and heart rate), makes disease predictions, and estimates medical costs based on patient data and insurance coverage. The integrated chatbot offers an interactive way for users to query their health status, receive personalized predictions, and access cost estimates in real time. The project leverages machine learning models and large language models (LLM) for prediction and natural language interaction, making healthcare management more accessible and user-friendly.
